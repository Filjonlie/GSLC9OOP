# GSLC9OOP

On this project, i am implementing a usage of Java interface, abstract, and classes. The project im creating is a restaurant project of a simple fast food chain selling burgers, chickens, fires, nuggets, and deserts. i create 5 classes for each category of fast food. i also create an interface called order to for the blueprint method for my abstract. i then create an abstract as the blueprint for my subclasses containing methods.
The Main program as usual asks for user input for the type of food they want to purchase and the amount. the program will then outpu some sentences and the receipt in form of the amoung, name, and total price of the wanted product. 
The purpose of me creating this project is actually as a form of testing for the AOL. my team and i are eager to create a project for a small restaurant UMKM using java. Thankyou sir.
